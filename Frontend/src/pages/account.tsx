                Accounting is the process of recording, analyzing, summarizing,
                and interpreting the financial information of a business
                organization. Accounting information thus generated is of use to
                the stakeholders of the company, namely the employees,
                shareholders, creditors, banks and other lenders, regulatory
                agencies and tax authorities, etc. It is the only way or
                language through which the organization can communicate with the
                internal and external world.
